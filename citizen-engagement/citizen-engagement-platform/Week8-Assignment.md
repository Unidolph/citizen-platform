## Week 8 Assignment Instructions for Citizen Engagement Platform

### Project Overview
The Citizen Engagement Platform is designed to facilitate citizen involvement in government projects. Users can view, create, update, and delete projects, ensuring transparency and accountability in government initiatives.

### Objectives
1. **Backend Development**: 
   - Set up a robust backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
   - Implement CRUD operations for managing government projects.
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation.

2. **Frontend Development**: 
   - Create an interactive frontend using React.js.
   - Develop components for displaying project lists and project details.
   - Implement routing for navigating between different pages.

### Requirements
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js (v18 or higher)
  - MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
  - Express.js
  - Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling
  - TypeScript for type safety

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - React Router for navigation
  - Axios for making HTTP requests
  - TypeScript for type safety

### Project Structure
- **Backend**:
  - `src/app.ts`: Entry point for the backend application.
  - `src/controllers/projectController.ts`: Handles CRUD operations for projects.
  - `src/models/project.ts`: Defines the Mongoose model for projects.
  - `src/routes/projectRoutes.ts`: Sets up routes for project-related endpoints.
  - `src/types/index.ts`: Defines TypeScript interfaces for project data.

- **Frontend**:
  - `src/App.tsx`: Main component that sets up routing.
  - `src/components/ProjectList.tsx`: Displays a list of government projects.
  - `src/pages/Home.tsx`: Landing page that includes the ProjectList component.
  - `src/types/index.ts`: Defines TypeScript interfaces for project data received from the backend.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Set up your MongoDB connection in `src/app.ts`.
   - Start the server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Start the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.

### Submission Guidelines
- Ensure all code is committed and pushed to your GitHub Classroom repository.
- Include comprehensive documentation in both the backend and frontend README files.
- Deploy your application and provide the live URL in your README.md.
- Create a video demonstration of your application and include the link in your README.md.
